  /*
  A list of changes made to documents in the database, in the order they were made. It returns an object with the method cancel(), which you call if you donâ€™t want to listen to new changes anymore.

  It is an event emitter and will emit a 'change' event on each document change,
  a 'complete' event when all the changes have been processed,
  and an 'error' event when an error occurs.
  In addition to the 'change' event, any change will also emit a 'create', 'update', or 'delete' event.

  ### Options
  All options default to false unless otherwise specified.

  options.live: Will emit change events for all future changes until cancelled.
  options.include_docs: Include the associated document with each change.
  options.conflicts: Include conflicts.
  options.attachments: Include attachments.
  options.binary: Return attachment data as Blobs/Buffers, instead of as base64-encoded strings.
  options.descending: Reverse the order of the output documents.
  options.since: Start the results from the change immediately after the given sequence number. You can also pass 'now' if you want only new changes (when live is true).
  options.limit: Limit the number of results to this number.
  options.timeout: Request timeout (in milliseconds).

  @usage
  var db = new px.mobile.DB('http://localhost:5984/default');
  var changes = db.changes({
    since: 'now',
    live: true,
    include_docs: true
  }).on('change', function(change) {
    // handle change
  }).on('complete', function(info) {
    // changes() was canceled
  }).on('error', function (err) {
    console.log(err);
  });

  changes.cancel(); // whenever you want to cancel
